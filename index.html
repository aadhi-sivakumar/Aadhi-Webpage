			<p style="text-indent:50px; color:#431c53;id="p1">Hello, my name is Aadhi. I was born on March 1, 2005. I am currently 14 years old and attend
				Sunset High School. I live with my family near Bonny Slope Elementary School. I have a little brother and an older sister
				who moved to stay with us to attend PSU. My older sister is from India but moved here since the colleges there are not the best. My dad and mom are both computer engineers so there was no possiblity that I wouldn't be taking a computer class when I came to Sunset High School. </p>
				<p style="text-indent:50px; color:#431c53"> I also participate in many sports and activities. I am a competitive runner and compete on the Sunset Cross Country team. I started running ever since middle school and accomplished many running acheivements ever since. I made it to Nationals for cross country in 7th grade and made it to regionals multiple years. I also competed on two teams when I	was in middle school. I was on the school team as well as a competitive team called Teammates Running Club. I also enjoy playing soccer a lot. Soccer was the first sport I played and I had a lot of friends who did it. I started competitive
				soccer when I was 10 and stopped when I decided to do XC in high school. I also really enjoy computer programming and using HTML and CSS to create websites and make it look pleasing. My dad enrolled me in a computer programming class
				during the summer when I was 12 to learn the basic javascript. Ever since that class, I was intrested in pursuing my passion and continue learning more about these languages. My favorite thing to do probably is hang out with my brother
				and play boardgames and videogames with my brother. I love playing Fifa and NBA 2k with him as well as playing Ticket to Ride with my family. I also have a huge obsession with baking desserts.</p>

          <p style="text-indent:50px">Like I said earlier, I am a competitive runner and want to pursue running in college. By the end of highschool, I really want to break 15:00 in the 5k and 9:00 in the 3k. I believe if I try hard, I can complete these goals. After high school, I really want to get accepted to Stanford or UCLA because they both have really good academics as well as running programs. I also heard their computer science programs are amazing!</p>
