# My First Website  

This project is the **first ever website I created** in my **Web Design class at Sunset High School**.  

The site was built to learn the basics of:  
- **HTML** for structure  
- **CSS** for styling  
- **Basic layouts** with text, images, and links  

It marks the starting point of my journey into web development and design.
